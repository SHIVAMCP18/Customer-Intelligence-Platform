# VoiceIQ Enterprise

Customer feedback is scattered across support tickets, reviews, surveys, call notes, and sales conversations — which means the loudest voice, not the most common or highest-impact one, tends to win roadmap debates. VoiceIQ turns that scattered feedback into a continuously updated, prioritized product opportunity map, so prioritization is evidence-based instead of anecdote-based.

**Live:** [customer-voice-intelligence-platfor.vercel.app](https://customer-voice-intelligence-platfor.vercel.app)

## What it does

- Ingests feedback from multiple channels (manual entry, CSV import, embeddable widget)
- Clusters feedback into themes using semantic embeddings
- Scores each theme by volume, sentiment, and business impact (RICE-based)
- Surfaces data-backed personas and an executive-ready narrative of what customers are asking for and why it matters

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Database / Auth:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Row-Level Security, pgvector)
- **AI:** Groq (Llama 3.3) for sentiment, summarization, and clustering labels
- **Caching / rate limiting:** Upstash Redis
- **Charts:** Recharts
