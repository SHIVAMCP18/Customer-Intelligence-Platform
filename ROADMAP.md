# Roadmap

Last updated: end of Sprint 2.

## MVP (Sprints 1–3)

The three sprints that take this from nothing to a demoable end-to-end loop.

- **Sprint 1 — Foundation & Feedback Ingestion:** multi-tenant auth/org/RBAC, core schema, three ingestion paths (manual, CSV, widget), filterable feedback list. *Done.* A user can sign up, create an org, invite teammates, import feedback via CSV or the embeddable widget (or log it manually), and browse/filter the result.
- **Sprint 2 — AI Clustering, Sentiment, and Opportunity Scoring:** embedding + clustering pipeline, sentiment/pain-point extraction, RICE-based opportunity scoring, trend view. *Done.* Feedback is automatically embedded, clustered into AI-labeled themes, sentiment-tagged, and scored; a trend view shows which themes are rising or falling. Pipeline verified against real data end to end, including real Hugging Face embeddings and real Groq output once those accounts were connected.
- **Sprint 3 — Personas, Roadmap Integration, Executive Layer:** data-backed personas, roadmap tracker linked to themes, competitive insight notes, auto-drafted executive summary, security/test hardening pass. *Done.* Every external service (Supabase, Groq, Hugging Face, Upstash, Vercel) is connected, and the full pipeline — widget submission → embedding → clustering → sentiment tagging → rate limiting — is verified live against the actual production deployment, not just local dev.

Full detail on each sprint's scope lives in [PROJECT_PLAN.md](./PROJECT_PLAN.md) and [PRD.md](./PRD.md).

## V1 (post-MVP hardening)

Goal: take the demoable loop and make it reliable enough for a real team to depend on daily, not just demo well.

- Real integrations beyond CSV: at minimum a Zendesk or Intercom export/API connector, evaluated against free-tier feasibility
- Configurable opportunity scoring weights per organization, instead of one fixed RICE formula
- Saved views / dashboards per persona (a PM's default view vs. an exec's)
- Notification/digest layer (e.g., weekly theme-movement summary) — needs a free-tier email provider evaluation
- Expanded audit log into a full activity feed, exportable for compliance-minded orgs

## V2 (exploratory, not committed)

Directional ideas, not yet scoped or sequenced:

- Multi-language feedback support (embedding models and sentiment models that generalize beyond English)
- Customer-facing changelog view that closes the loop ("you asked, we shipped") — would cross into Canny territory deliberately, once the core analysis product is proven
- Predictive churn-risk scoring that factors in theme sentiment trends per account, not just aggregate
- Public API for feedback ingestion beyond the embeddable widget, with proper API-key management and usage tiers
- Real revenue-impact input (CRM/ARR linkage) replacing the Sprint-2 placeholder in the opportunity scoring formula

## Explicitly out of scope for the foreseeable future

- Native mobile apps
- Becoming a public feature-voting board (see [COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](./COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md) — deliberately not competing with Canny on that axis)
- Billing/payments infrastructure until pricing strategy is validated (see [PRICING_STRATEGY.md](./PRICING_STRATEGY.md))
